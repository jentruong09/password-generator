## Usage
Once you launch the application, you will see the following page launch:

![password-generator-pic1](/assets/images/hw3_1.jpg)

<br/>

Once you click the 'Generate Password' button you will be prompted the question regarding how many characters you want your password to be:

![password-generator-pic2](/assets/images/hw3_2.jpg)

<br/>

If you enter a character length that is less than 8 or greater than 128 then you will be prompted with an alert message:

![password-generator-pic2.1](/assets/images/hw3_2.1.jpg)

<br/>

If the character length chosen is within the range, the following 4 confirmations will pop up:

<br/>

Lower Case Letters:
![password-generator-pic3](/assets/images/hw3_3.jpg)

<br/>

Upper Case Letters:
![password-generator-pic4](/assets/images/hw3_4.jpg)

<br/>

Numbers:
![password-generator-pic5](/assets/images/hw3_5.jpg)

<br/>

Special Characters:
![password-generator-pic6](/assets/images/hw3_6.jpg)

<br/>

If 'cancel' was selected for all the character types then the following alert will be pop up:

![password-generator-pic7](/assets/images/hw3_7.jpg)

<br/>

If at least one character choice was chosen, then an automated password would generate:

![password-generator-pic8](/assets/images/hw3_8.jpg)
